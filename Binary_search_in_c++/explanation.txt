How Binary Search Works üßê
Binary search operates on the principle of "divide and conquer." For it to work, the collection of elements (like an array) must be sorted first.

Here's the step-by-step process:

Find the Middle: Start by examining the middle element of the sorted array.

Compare:

If the middle element is the target value, the search is complete.

If the target value is less than the middle element, the target must be in the left half of the array. You can discard the entire right half.

If the target value is greater than the middle element, the target must be in the right half. You can discard the entire left half.

Repeat: Continue this process of halving the remaining search space and comparing until the target value is found or the search space is empty (meaning the value isn't in the array).

Of course. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Its time complexity is O(logn).

Time Complexity Analysis ‚è≥
The time complexity of binary search is a key reason for its popularity.

Worst-Case and Average-Case Time Complexity: O(logn)
This is because the algorithm halves the input size with each step. If you start with an array of size n, after one comparison, you are left with n/2 elements. After the second, n/4, and so on. The number of steps (k) it takes to get down to a single element can be expressed as:

n/2 
k
 =1

Solving for k, we get:

n=2 
k
 ‚üπk=log 
2
‚Äã
 n

Thus, the number of operations grows logarithmically with the size of the input, making it extremely fast for large datasets compared to a linear search (O(n)).

Best-Case Time Complexity: O(1)
This occurs when the target element happens to be the middle element of the array on the very first check.

Space Complexity: O(1)
For the iterative implementation shown above, the space complexity is constant because it only uses a few variables (left, right, mid) to keep track of the search space, regardless of the array's size. A recursive implementation would have a space complexity of O(logn) due to the call stack.
